I am currently a Marie Curie cofund postdoctoral fellow working in the Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, UK. My research focuses on exploring the structural and electronic properties of low-dimensional materials utilising ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques. I am passionate about applying sophisticated surface science tools to broader research areas encompassing material science, nanoscience, and physical chemistry. My recent project involves the investigation of the structure-property relationship of conjugated polymers, which has shown very promising applications in organic electronics. I speak fluently English and French, and I am also a beginner in German. During my free time I love outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing.
