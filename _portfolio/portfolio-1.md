title: "Chill in the air"
excerpt: "In a world where everyone finds a unique call of the wild, I found mine amidst the untouched snow and towering peaks. As a passionate skier, every winter is a return to my sanctuary, where the world narrows down to the trail under my feet and the rhythm of my heart beating against the chill in the air.<br/><img src='/images/snow.jpg' width ='600'>"
